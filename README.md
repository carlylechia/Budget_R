# BUDGET APP

The Budget_R app was built as the capstone project at the end of the Ruby on Rails module at @Microverse. It is about building a mobile web application where you, the user, can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.

You will create a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:

 * register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
 * introduce new transactions associated with a category.
 * see the money spent on each category.
